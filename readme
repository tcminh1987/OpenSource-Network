Open Source Networking Projects: A Current List
Ethan Banks

Last updated April 22, 2024

    Thank you to the many list contributors that added their favorite projects to this LinkedIn thread. I had no idea how much joyful work I was creating for myself when I posted it.

    ü§î Did we miss a project? Tell us about it here.

About This List

This list of public projects is provided as a service to the IT infrastructure community by Packet Pushers. The goal is to spread awareness of tools that might make your job easier.

Consider that these networking projects are all, to the best of my knowledge, free and open source. That means three important things.

    The project is open to you. Generally the code is found in a publicly accessible code repository such as GitHub or GitLab. If you understand the code, you can confirm that it‚Äôs safe, secure, and suitable for you to run. If you don‚Äôt understand the code, you can hope that others who do have reviewed the code and addressed flaws.
    The project is contributable by you. Open source projects tend to be started by individuals with an itch to scratch or problem to solve. When these projects become popular, they also become a time-consuming burden to their authors. Without community contributors, these projects become unsustainable and die. Seriously consider giving back. Writing documentation is as valuable a service as coding.
    The project is free for you to use, but might not be free for you to incorporate into your own for-profit projects. The licenses vary with these projects. Be careful to review the license associated with a project before re-using the code as part of your own unique project.

Not All Free Open Source Software Is The Same

Open source networking projects exist for a variety of reasons. Those reasons could influence whether or not you want to use a given project, so it‚Äôs a good idea to know what‚Äôs going on with a project before you make it an important part of your network.

    Vendor or business-backed projects. Some projects are backed by vendors or service providers who need the project to support their own networks or products. These folks will generally employ people to write code for the project. These projects might serve you well, but the first priority of the maintainers is meeting the needs of the businesses funding them. Probably not your needs.
    Projects as marketing tools. Other projects are marketing tools created by vendors to create awareness of a related product they want you to buy. That doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs anything wrong with their project, but be aware of the project‚Äôs point of view. I have eliminated from this list vendor-driven projects of no particular use unless you‚Äôre in the vendor‚Äôs ecosystem.
    Open, community, and feature-limited projects. Yet other projects you‚Äôll find here might be open or community editions with commercial variants that may not be free or open source. That means the author hopes to feed their families with their programming efforts using the freemium model. You have to feed your family too, which should give you pause to think. Even though the projects here won‚Äôt cost you money, nothing is free. Every line of code represented in this list cost someone something.
    Altruistic projects. Some projects exist for the betterment of the community with no strings attached. If you get a benefit from the project, you should let the maintainer know how you‚Äôre using it and express your appreciation. That would be cool of you.

How To Use This Open Source Networking List

The list lacks a perfect heading for every project under a given category. Therefore, you should read category headings and the projects with an open mind, recognizing that a project might be capable of more than what the heading implies.

The Packet Pushers team has not personally tried all of these projects. A project‚Äôs inclusion here isn‚Äôt an endorsement or even a recommendation. Use your own discretion before using any of the software identified here.

Attribution. Most project descriptions are quoted from the project‚Äôs website, code repo, documentation, or wiki, and might be edited for brevity.

Network Unit Testing System (NUTS)
https://github.com/network-unit-testing-system/nuts
The Network Unit Testing System or ‚Äúnuts‚Äù in short draws on the concept of unit tests, known from the domain of programming, and applies it to the domain of networking. In the network testing domain, tests are less about edge cases, but more about testing existing network states with pre-defined test cases. Such a single test case might be ‚Äúcan host A reach neighbors X, Y, Z?‚Äù on many different devices. This is what nuts tries to achieve: Apply test cases based on your pre-defined network topology to your actual network and have the tests confirm the correct state.

Nornir
https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir

Terraform
https://www.terraform.io/use-cases/manage-network-infrastructure
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform
IT automation system. Build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. It‚Äôs notable that Hashicorp, the company behind Terraform, changed Terraform‚Äôs licensing in mid-2023 such that another project can‚Äôt use Terraform source code to make a competing product. This caused outrage for some in the TF community, with purists insisting that Terraform is no longer truly open source. The main result of this outrage was the OpenTofu project, a fork of Terraform that‚Äôs part of the Linux Foundation and backed by many commercial interests. If open source licensing distinctions are important to you or your company, pay careful attention to Terraform‚Äôs licensing.
